# c6502

6502 emulator written in c.

Home video game consoles and home computers of the 1970s through the early 1990s, such as the Atari 2600, Atari 8-bit computers, Apple II, Nintendo Entertainment System, Commodore 64, Atari Lynx, BBC Micro and others, use the 6502 processor.

I grew up playing a lot these console so I thought it will be fun to emulate the processor first and maybe later if time permit emulate one of these console next.

The refrence listed below was used to implement the 6502 emulator:
