# c6502

Welcome to **c6502** — a retro computing adventure brought to life in C!

The legendary 6502 processor powered a generation of classics. From the Atari 2600, Apple II, and Commodore 64 to the Nintendo Entertainment System and beyond, these machines sparked the imaginations of millions from the 1970s through the early 1990s.

I grew up immersed in the magic of these consoles, and I always wondered what made them tick. This project started as a personal challenge: Could I capture the heart of those beloved systems by emulating the mighty 6502? My first goal is a faithful processor emulator; if time allows, maybe one day it’ll breathe new life into a retro console or two!

### References and Inspirations

Whether you’re here to reminisce, learn, or hack, I hope you enjoy diving into 6502 emulation as much as I enjoyed building it!
